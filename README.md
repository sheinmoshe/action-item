## 🚀 Quick Start

** This projecct uses Vue3 with Typescript and jest for testing
** State was handled using composition API with no extra libraries or framworks


** For backend I used a JSON file. This is to simply implentation and avoid working with sqlLite that doesn't support object as type

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   # Backend
   cd backend
   npm install

   # Frontend
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   ``

3. **Start development servers:**
   # Backend (from backend directory)
   npm run start:dev
